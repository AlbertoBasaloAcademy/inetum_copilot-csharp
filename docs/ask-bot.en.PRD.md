# PRD ‚Äî AskBot CLI

## 1. Executive Summary

Educational CLI that queries public APIs to provide basic information about the user's IP and related services: location, weather, currency, time, and solar data. The goal is to present students with a functional terminal program that demonstrates consuming external services and handling JSON data.

### 1.1 Goals and Metrics

  * Build a working CLI application with all commands functional locally.
  * Demonstrate successful consumption of public, free REST APIs.
  * Implement error handling for unavailable external services.

### 1.2 Audience

  * Students: to gain practical experience with API consumption.
  * Instructors: to use as guidance and to assess learning outcomes.

### 1.3 Technologies
  * Language: C# with .NET 9+.
  * Libraries: Minimal, preferably only `System.Net.Http` and `System.Text.Json`.
  * Tools: Visual Studio Code, or Visual Studio with the .NET CLI
  * Deployment: Runnable application using `dotnet run <command>`.

## 2. Scope

  * Included: CLI with 4 main commands to query location, weather, currency, and solar information.
  * Excluded: GUI, data persistence, authentication, notifications.

### 2.1 User Stories

  * As a user, I want to know my current location based on my IP.
  * As a user, I want to know today's forecast for my city.
  * As a user, I want to see the official currency of my country and basic exchange rates.
  * As a user, I want to know sunrise and sunset times.

### 2.2 Functional Requirements

1.  RF-1: `loc` or no command - Show city, country, latitude/longitude obtained from [ipapi.co](https://ipapi.co/json/) or [ip-api.com](http://ip-api.com/json/).
2.  RF-2: `weather` - Show current temperature, chance of rain, and a weather code from [open-meteo.com](https://open-meteo.com/).
3.  RF-3: `money` - Show the country's official currency and exchange rates vs EUR/USD/GBP/CHF from [frankfurter.dev](https://api.frankfurter.dev/v1/latest).
4.  RF-4: `sun` - Show sunrise and sunset times from [open-meteo.com](https://open-meteo.com/).

### 2.3 Additional Functional Requirements

5.  RF-5: `askbot help` - Show help with a list of available commands and their description.
6.  RF-6: `askbot --version` - Show the application's current version.
7.  RF-7: All commands must handle connectivity errors and show informative messages.

### 2.4 Non-Functional Requirements

  * Simplicity: Prioritize clarity and simplicity in implementation and usage.
  * Performance: CLI responses should be fast, preferably under 1 second with active connectivity.
  * Availability: Gracefully handle unavailability of external services.
  * Usability: Intuitive commands and clear, helpful error messages.


## 3. Data Model and APIs

### 3.1 Geolocation:

- `curl http://ip-api.com/json/`

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "country": "Spain",
  "countryCode": "ES",
  "region": "GA",
  "regionName": "Galicia",
  "city": "A Coru√±a",
  "zip": "15009",
  "lat": 43.3626,

  "isp": "Telefonica de Espana SAU",
  "org": "RIMA (Red IP Multi Acceso)",
  "as": "AS3352 TELEFONICA DE ESPANA S.A.U.",
  "query": "81.39.197.0"
}
```

### 3.2 Weather:
- `curl "https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=43.3626&longitude=-8.4012&current_weather=true"`
```json
{
  "latitude": 43.3626,
  "longitude": -8.4012,
  "generationtime_ms": 0.02491474151611328,
  "utc_offset_seconds": 0,

  "current_units": {
    "time": "iso8601",
    "interval": "seconds",
    "temperature": "¬∞C"
  },
  "current": {
    "time": "2025-09-13T06:45",
    "interval": 900,
    "temperature": 14.3
  }
}
```

### 3.3 Currency:
- `curl https://api.frankfurter.dev/v1/latest` - Exchange rates

```json
{
  "amount": 1.0,
  "base": "EUR",
  "date": "2024-09-13",
  "rates": {
    "USD": 1.08,
    "GBP": 0.86,
    "CHF": 0.97
  }
}
```

### 3.4 Solar:
- `curl "https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=52.52&longitude=13.419998&daily=sunrise,sunset&timezone=Europe%2FBerlin"` - Sunrise and sunset information

```json
{
  "latitude": 52.52,
  "longitude": 13.419998,
  "generationtime_ms": 0.006198883056640625,
  "utc_offset_seconds": 7200,
  "timezone": "Europe/Berlin",
  "timezone_abbreviation": "GMT+2",
  "elevation": 38,
  "daily_units": {
    "time": "iso8601",
    "sunrise": "iso8601",
    "sunset": "iso8601"
  },
  "daily": {
    "time": [
      "2025-09-13"
    ],
    "sunrise": [
      "2025-09-13T06:37"
    ],
    "sunset": [
      "2025-09-13T19:26"
    ]
  }
}
```

## 4. Acceptance Criteria and Risks

### 4.1 Acceptance Criteria

  * Each command returns human-readable structured text.
  * The CLI runs from a terminal without errors.
  * Connectivity errors and unavailable APIs are handled properly.
  * Commands respond in less than 3 seconds under normal conditions.
  * The application shows clear help messages when run without parameters.

### 4.2 Risks

  * External APIs unavailable: provide informative fallback messages.
  * API rate limits: inform the user about possible restrictions.
  * Network connectivity: handle timeouts and connection errors gracefully.
  * API changes: public APIs can change structure without notice.
