AlbertoBasalo: Implement #file:1-Weather forecast.spec.md 
Read and Follow instructions:
- #file:lng_csharp.instructions.md 
- #file:bst_clean-code.instructions.md 

GitHub Copilot: I'll inspect the codebase to find the existing Askbot implementation and weather-related files so I can update them to match the spec. I'll read the main files (`Program.cs`, `IpApi.cs`, `IpClient.cs`, `Weather.cs`) to understand current behavior. Expected outcome: identify gaps and plan changes. I'll mark the first todo as in-progress and then read the files. 

Created 5 todos

Now I'll read the key source files to understand current implementation.

Updating the todo list: mark analysis task completed and start implementing the weather command. 

Starting (2/5) *Implement weather command*

I'll open the project file to ensure build settings and target framework before implementing. I'll read `Askbot.csproj`. 

Read [](file:///c%3A/code/live/inetum_copilot-csharp/src/Askbot/Askbot.csproj)

I'll update Program.cs and Weather.cs to implement the weather command per spec: async Main, parse args, validate coords, call Open-Meteo, map weather codes, and handle errors. Expected outcome: project compiles and `askbot weather` returns the formatted weather string. 

Using "Apply Patch"


```

```
I'll implement Weather.FetchWeatherAsync in Weather.cs to satisfy the new call: it will accept optional lat/lon and IpApi for fallback, call Open-Meteo, map weather code to description, and format the output. Then I'll run build. 

Using "Apply Patch"


```

```
I'll fix nullable warnings by checking for nulls and handling missing fields defensively. Then run a build. 

Using "Apply Patch"


```

```
Now I'll run a dotnet build to ensure the project compiles. I'll run the build in the repository's Askbot project folder.
I'll run 'dotnet build' in the Askbot project to compile and catch errors. Expected outcome: successful build or targeted errors to fix. 

Ran terminal command: cd /c/code/live/inetum_copilot-csharp/src/Askbot && dotnet build -clp:Summary

Build succeeded with warnings. I'll run a quick smoke run of the program 'dotnet run -- weather' to see output; network calls will run and may fail depending on environment. I'll run it to validate output formatting. 

Ran terminal command: cd /c/code/live/inetum_copilot-csharp/src/Askbot && dotnet run -- weather

Progress update:
- Read key files and implemented the weather command.
- Implemented async Main and Weather.FetchWeatherAsync, added mapping and error handling.
- Built and ran a smoke test; output returned as expected.
Next steps: finalize todos: add tests or adjust IP client nullability and add README note. I'll mark the weather implementation todo completed and start adding a small README usage note. 

Starting (3/5) *Add error handling and tests*

I'll add a short usage note to README.md under the project root describing the weather command. 

Read [](file:///c%3A/code/live/inetum_copilot-csharp/README.md)

Using "Apply Patch"


```

```
I'll mark documentation todo completed and the tests todo remains in-progress; propose lightweight unit tests later. Now I'll update the todo list statuses accordingly. 

Completed (5/5) *Document changes*

I'll implement the Weather command and wire it into the CLI, follow the C# and clean-code guidelines, build and run a smoke test, and add a small README usage note. Below is a concise progress update and what I changed.

## Actions taken
- Read the existing code in Askbot (files inspected: Program.cs, IpApi.cs, IpClient.cs, Weather.cs, Askbot.csproj).
- Implemented an async weather command and a complete weather fetcher that:
  - Uses `ip-api.com` result (from existing `IpApiClient.FetchIp()`) when coordinates are not passed.
  - Calls Open-Meteo API for current weather.
  - Parses temperature and attempts to retrieve precipitation probability for the current hour.
  - Maps Open-Meteo/WMO numeric weather codes to short text descriptions.
  - Validates coordinates when provided.
  - Returns a human-readable header and lines per the spec (temperature rounded to 1 decimal, precipitation or "N/A", condition string).
- Added friendly error handling and appropriate exit codes for common error modes.
- Built the project and ran a smoke test of `dotnet run -- weather`.
- Updated README.md with usage notes for `askbot weather` and `askbot weather <lat> <lon>`.
- Tracked progress with the required todo list (items completed/in-progress noted).

## Files changed
- Program.cs
  - Converted Main to `async Task Main(...)`.
  - Parsed command line args for `weather` and optional `lat lon`.
  - Calls `Weather.FetchWeatherAsync(lat, lon, ip)` and prints the formatted result.
  - Adds argument validation and friendly error messages with specific exit codes for different error types.
- Weather.cs
  - New implementation for `FetchWeatherAsync(double? lat, double? lon, IpApi ipApi)`.
  - Calls Open-Meteo current weather API and parses JSON with System.Text.Json.
  - Maps weather codes to short descriptions (based on WMO/Open-Meteo codes).
  - Attempts to extract hourly precipitation probability aligned to current time if present; otherwise shows "N/A".
  - Returns a formatted string matching the spec (header with location when available, temperature in ¬∞C rounded to 1 decimal, precipitation or "N/A", condition).
- README.md
  - Added two usage examples for the weather command.

## Build & smoke test results
- Ran dotnet build in Askbot ‚Üí Build succeeded with 3 nullable warnings originating in IpClient.cs (these are non-fatal).
- Ran `dotnet run -- weather` in Askbot (smoke test). Example output observed:
  - Printed IP and location.
  - Fetched and printed weather, e.g.:
    - "üå§Ô∏è Weather in A Coru√±a, Spain:"
    - "Temperature: 16.7¬∞C"
    - "Precipitation: N/A"
    - "Condition: Partly cloudy"
- No crashes; network calls succeeded in smoke run. If run in an environment without network access, the program will surface friendly error messages and non-zero exit codes per the implementation.

## Contract (short)
- Inputs:
  - CLI: `weather` or `weather <lat> <lon>` (decimal degrees). If omitted, uses public IP geolocation.
- Outputs:
  - Human-friendly lines: location header (when available), temperature ¬∞C (1 decimal), precipitation chance or "N/A", and a short condition string.
- Errors:
  - Invalid coordinates ‚Üí prints message and sets exit code 1.
  - Network/API failure ‚Üí prints "Weather service unavailable ‚Äî try again later" and sets exit code 2.
  - Unexpected errors ‚Üí prints message and sets exit code 3.

## Edge cases considered
- No coordinates + IP lookup fails ‚Üí handled with "Unable to resolve location" message (ArgumentException).
- Coordinates out of range ‚Üí validates and errors with friendly message.
- Open-Meteo response missing expected fields ‚Üí throws and is handled by the top-level try/catches which output a friendly error.
- Precipitation probability may not be present for the current hour ‚Üí then shows "N/A".

## Requirements coverage
- Read and followed `lng_csharp.instructions.md` and `bst_clean-code.instructions.md`:
  - Followed C# best practices: `async/await`, nullability checks, guard clauses, small cohesive methods.
  - Kept dependencies minimal (System.Net.Http, System.Text.Json).
- Implemented behavior from `docs/specs/1-Weather forecast.spec.md`:
  - Resolves location via IP when no coords provided.
  - Queries Open-Meteo current weather API.
  - Outputs temperature (rounded to 1 decimal), precipitation chance (if available) or "N/A", and condition text.
  - Prints header with city and country when available.
  - Handles network and geolocation errors with friendly messages and non-zero exit codes.

## Next steps (optional / recommended)
- Add small unit tests:
  - Mock HttpClient to simulate Open-Meteo and IP-API responses and validate parsing and error messages.
- Tighten nullability in `IpClient.FetchIp()` to remove nullable warnings (prefer Task-based async and better null handling).
- Add logging and cancellation support for long-running requests.
- Consider adding a small integration test that is skipped in CI unless network is available.

If you want, I can:
- Add unit tests (xUnit + Microsoft.Extensions.Http mocking).
- Convert `IpClient.FetchIp()` to an async method and remove blocking `.Result` calls (recommended).
- Harden formatting and localization of decimals (right now invariant culture is used for API calls and output formatting uses default culture for display ‚Äî we can prefer invariant or force '.' formatting).

Would you like me to add unit tests and convert the IP client to async next?

Made changes.

AlbertoBasalo: Follow instructions in [git-commit.prompt.md](file:///c%3A/code/live/inetum_copilot-csharp/.github/prompts/git-commit.prompt.md).

GitHub Copilot: I'll run git commands to stage and create two commits: one for the implementation (code) and one for the README docs; then I'll show git status to confirm a clean working tree. Expected outcome: two commits created and working tree clean. 

Ran terminal command: cd /c/code/live/inetum_copilot-csharp && git status --porcelain && git add src/Askbot/Program.cs src/Askbot/Weather.cs && git commit -m "feat(weather): add Open-Meteo current weather support and CLI wiring" -m "Implemented async CLI 'weather' command that uses IP geolocation (ip-api.com) as fallback and calls Open-Meteo current weather API. Parses temperature, precipitation probability (when present), maps weather codes to short text, validates coordinates, and formats user-facing output." && git add README.md && git commit -m "docs(readme): add weather usage examples" -m "Document how to run 'weather' with and without coordinates." && git status --porcelain && git log --pretty=oneline -n 3

I'm committing the changes now and verifying the repository status.

What I did
- Created two logical commits following Conventional Commits:
  - feat(weather): add Open-Meteo current weather support and CLI wiring
    - Implemented async `weather` CLI, `Weather.FetchWeatherAsync(...)`, mapping of weather codes, precipitation extraction when available, validation and friendly errors.
  - docs(readme): add weather usage examples
    - Added README usage lines for `weather` and `weather <lat> <lon>`.

Validation (what I ran and results)
- I staged and committed the modified files.
- Git log (recent commits):
  - 2be6c2e ‚Äî docs(readme): add weather usage examples
  - fbe4872 ‚Äî feat(weather): add Open-Meteo current weather support and CLI wiring
- Git working tree status: there are no modified tracked files left to commit, but there are two untracked paths:
  - .github/
  - docs/specs/
  - (These are untracked, shown as ?? in git status. Tracked files we changed are committed.)

Notes and next steps
- If you want the workspace fully ‚Äúclean‚Äù (no untracked files), I can:
  - Add and commit the untracked files (if they should be tracked), or
  - Add them to .gitignore if they should remain untracked.
- Recommended next work (I can do these if you want):
  - Convert `IpClient.FetchIp()` to async to avoid blocking `.Result` calls and remove the nullable warnings.
  - Add unit tests (xUnit) with an HttpClient mock for the Open-Meteo and ip-api responses.
  - Add small integration test or CI step to run the smoke test.

Would you like me to:
- push these commits to the remote (I won't push without your go-ahead), or
- commit the untracked .github and specs files, or
- proceed with converting the IP client to async and adding tests now?
