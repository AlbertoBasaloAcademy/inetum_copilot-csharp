# Write XUnit Tests

Test the given specification writing unit tests using XUnit framework.

## Context

Read and follow the instructions with best practices and coding standards from:

- [bst_unit-test.instructions.md](../instructions/bst_unit-test.instructions.md)
- [frm_x-unit.instructions.md](../instructions/frm_x-unit.instructions.md)

## Workflow

1. Read the given specification carefully.
2. Write tests for the specification in the target programming language, following best practices and coding standards.
3. Run the tests to ensure they pass.
4. If tests do not pass, fix them and try again.
5. If still not passing, write a log explaining the issue and stop.
6. Run the git commit [./git-commit.prompt.md](./git-commit.prompt.md) prompt.
